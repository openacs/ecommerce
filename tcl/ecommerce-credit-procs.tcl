} { 

    Authorizes the credit card for use with an order. Gets info it
    needs from database. Card_code does comes from mem to avoid storing in db.
    Connects to the payment gateway to
    authorize card. Outputs one of the following strings,
    corresponding to the level of authorization:

    (a) failed_authorization When the payment gateway declined
    authorization of the transaction. Or when no payment gateway has
    been selected.

    (b) authorized When the transaction is successfully authorized
    and passed the address verification.

    (c) no_recommendation When the payment gateway gives an error
    that is unrelated to the credit card used, such as timeout or
    failure-retry.

    (d) invalid_input When there are no orders with the given
    order_id or with no billing_zip. This case shouldn't
    happen, since this proc is called from a tcl script with a known
    order_id, and billing_zip shouldn't be null.

    Connect to the payment gateway to charge a previously authorized
    credit card for a transaction. This marks the transaction for
    settlement by the credit card gateway at the end of the day (or
    what ever time the gateway uses).

    Returns one of the following strings corresponding to whether or
    not the post authorization was successful:

    (a) success The outcome in most cases because there are few
    chances for failure

    (b) failure May occur when there is a communication failure
    with the payment gateway. Also, most payment gateways will fail
    a post authorization if the transaction has already been marked
    or if the post authorization amount is higher than the original
    authorized amount. Of course, the .tcl script that calls this
    proc shouldn't be trying to mark an transaction that's already
    been marked and, because the transaction amount is stored in the
    database , there should be no discrepancy in the authorized
    amount and the post authorization amount.

    (c) invalid_input Occurs if there is no transaction with the
    given transaction_id.  If case (c) occurs, then there is
    probably an error in the .tcl script that called this proc.

    (d) unknown This proc returns "unknown" if cases (a), (b) and
    (c) do not apply. And when a temporary error at the payment
    gateway failed the post authorization.

    Prechecks credit card numbers. If you're going to accept cards
    other than MasterCard, Visa, or American Express, you'll have to
    modify this proc to recognize them.  It should be easy; just
    look at the proc ec_creditcard_validation to see how different
    card numbers are formed. 

    This script does some basic checks on the credit card and
    returns a list containing exception_count, exception_text.  

    The creditcard_number shouldn't contain any special characters;
    numbers only. The check to see whether the creditcard_number or
    creditcard_type is the empty string should be done separately.

    m = mastercard,
    v = visa,
    a = american express
    n = discover / novus

    This procedure validates a credit card number. It was originally
    called valCC, and was written by Horace Vallas. The original was
    found at http://www.hav.com/valCC/nph-src.htm?valCC.nws (with an
    HTML demo at
    https://enterprise.neosoft.com/secureforms/hav/default.htm).  It
    has been left unchanged except for the name.

    This is a demo NeoWebScript by Horace Vallas (3-7-97) according
    to some info I found on the web that was attibuted to ICVERIFY
    by Hal Stiles hstiles@beachnet.com
    http://www.beachnet.com/~hstiles/cardtype.html. You are welcome
    to use it; however, I make no warranty whatsoever about the
    accuracy or usefullness of this script. By using this script,
    you are agreeing that I am not responsible for any damage, of
    any kind whatsoever, to you or to any of your customers,
    clients, partners, friends, relatives, children born or unborne,
    pets, invisible friends, etc. etc. etc.

    The valCC proc can be used to validate a credit card number as
    being legally formed.

    Input is the entered card number.

    Return is the type of card (if validated) or "- unknown-" if it
    is an unknown or invalid number

    The validation applied (last known date 3/96) is the so called
    LUHN Formula (Mod 10) for Validation of Primary Account Number.

    Validation criteria are:
      1. number prefix
      2. number of digits
      3. mod10  (for all but enRoute which uses only 1 & 2)

    Each card type has the following criteria requirements:
    
    Card Type        Prefix            Length    Check-Digit Algorithm
    
    MC                51 - 55              16        mod 10
    
    VISA        4            13, 16        mod 10
    
    AMX                34, 37              15        mod 10

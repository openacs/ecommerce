  <p>The big decision:</p>

  <ol type="A">
    <li>you are the retailer</li>
    <li>you send all orders to one retailer</li>
    <li>you offer products and send orders to multiple retailers</li>
    <li>you let an arbitrary number of retailers come to your site and
      build shops (Yahoo! Store; Amazon Z Shops)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>OpenaACS supports the first three ways of doing business and will
  eventually support the last one (clone of Yahoo! Store).</p>

  <h3>High-level features</h3>

  <p>If your imagination is limited, you can think of this as
  "Amazon.com in a box".  Is is it impressive to do everything that
  Amazon does?  Not really.  Ecommerce is a fast-moving field.
  Packaged software always embodies last year's business ideas.  The
  interesting thing is how quickly one can extend an open-source
  software system to accommodate the latest business ideas.</p>

  <h3>Bottom line</h3>

  <p>If a closed-source ecommerce package doesn't do exactly what you
  want, you're out of business.  If the company behind a closed-source
  ecommerce package goes out of business, so will you.  If the company
  behind a closed-source ecommerce adopts a different "business
  model", you're screwed.</p>

  <p>If you're even tempted to adopt a commercial ecommerce system
  from a company other than IBM, Oracle or SAP (three enterprise
  software vendors that seem likely to be around for awhile), read the
  iCat story towards the end of <a

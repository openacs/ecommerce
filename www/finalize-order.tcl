    (1) put this order into the 'confirmed' state
    (2) try to authorize the user's credit card info and either
        (a) redirect them to a thank you page, or
        (b) redirect them to a "please fix your credit card info" 
            page

# If they reload, we don't have to worry about the credit card
# authorization code being executed twice because the order has
# already been moved to the 'confirmed' state, which means that they
# will be redirected out of this page.  We will redirect them to the
# thank you page which displays the order with the most recent
# confirmation date.  The only potential problem is that maybe the
# first time the order got to this page it was confirmed but then
# execution of the page stopped before authorization of the order
# could occur.  This problem is solved by the scheduled procedure,
# ec_query_for_payment_zombies, which will try to authorize any
# 'confirmed' orders over half an hour old.
